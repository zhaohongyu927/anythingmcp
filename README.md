> 🏭 **Origin story** — AnythingMCP started inside a German industrial group that needed AI agents to talk to 15+ legacy systems (ERP, CRM, custom SOAP, on-prem Postgres). Writing one MCP server per system would have taken weeks each; we extracted the common gateway after the third rewrite and have been running it in production for ~6 months.

## What is AnythingMCP?

**AnythingMCP** is a self-hosted, source-available **MCP server** and **API gateway** that turns your existing APIs into [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools. Connect **any** API — REST, SOAP, GraphQL, databases, or other MCP servers — and expose them to AI clients like **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, **Google Gemini**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and any other MCP-compatible client.

No SDK. No code changes. Just point, configure, and connect.

**Built-in adapters** ship with the catalog so you get an instant MCP server for popular SaaS and public APIs — DHL, DPD, GLS, Shipcloud, Sendcloud, Deutsche Bahn, DATEV, Weclapp, Xentral, Shopware 6, Personio, Handelsregister, VIES VAT, OpenPLZ, HERE Geocoding, Oxomi and more (full list [below](#pre-configured-mcp-connectors)).

> **Looking for an MCP gateway?** AnythingMCP acts as a universal MCP proxy and API-to-MCP bridge — the missing middleware between your APIs and AI agents.

---

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp.git
cd anythingmcp && ./setup.sh

## Pre-configured MCP Connectors

AnythingMCP ships with **29 ready-to-use MCP server adapters** — provide your API credentials at import time and the tools become available to your AI client immediately. Each adapter has its own setup guide on [anythingmcp.com](https://anythingmcp.com/guides) (English, German, Italian).

> 📍 **Heads-up on the catalog:** the starting set leans heavily DACH (Germany / Austria / Switzerland) because that's where we built this in production first. US/UK/APAC SaaS adapters are very welcome as community PRs — there's a [good first issue](https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp/issues/150) walking you through adding one in ~30 minutes (it's a single JSON file).

**Want to add your own?** Create a JSON adapter file in `packages/backend/src/adapters/` (organized by region, e.g. `de/`), register it in `catalog.ts`, and it becomes available to all users. The new `catalog.spec.ts` parametrized test validates every adapter at build time. See the existing adapters and the [Tool Definition Format](docs/tool-definition.md) for the expected schema.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp.git
cd anythingmcp
./setup.sh                 # Interactive setup — generates .env, starts Docker
```

The setup script configures everything interactively: deployment mode, domain/SSL, auth, email, Redis, and more. All secrets are auto-generated. First user to register becomes Admin.

**What `setup.sh` handles:**
- Domain and HTTPS — for production domains, enables **Caddy** reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL
- Secrets — generates JWT, encryption keys, and database passwords
- MCP authentication mode — OAuth 2.0, API Key, or both
- Optional SMTP and Redis configuration

> **Prefer manual setup?** Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, edit the values, and run `docker compose up -d`. See the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) for details.

| Service | Default URL |
|---------|-------------|
| Web UI | `http://localhost:3000` (or `https://yourdomain.com` with Caddy) |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:4000` |
| MCP Endpoint | `http://localhost:4000/mcp` |
| Swagger Docs | `http://localhost:4000/api/docs` |

> **Next step:** Create a connector, import your API spec, and connect your AI client. See the [Connector Guides](#connector-guides) below.

```

**How it works:**

1. **Create a Connector** — Point to your API (REST base URL, WSDL endpoint, GraphQL URL, database connection string) or pick a pre-built adapter from the catalog
2. **Import or Define Tools** — Auto-import from OpenAPI/Postman/WSDL/GraphQL or define manually. Pre-built adapters skip this step.
3. **Connect AI Clients** — Point your MCP client to `http://your-server:4000/mcp`
4. **AI calls tools** — AnythingMCP translates MCP tool calls into actual API requests and returns results

## FAQ

### What is an MCP server?

An **MCP server** exposes tools to an AI agent over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — an open standard from Anthropic. Once connected, the AI can call those tools to read data, run queries, or perform actions on your behalf. AnythingMCP is a self-hosted MCP server that wraps your existing APIs so you don't have to write one from scratch.

### How is AnythingMCP different from writing my own MCP server?

You don't write code. AnythingMCP imports your OpenAPI/Postman/WSDL spec (or you point it at a database) and generates the MCP tools automatically. You also get auth, audit logging, RBAC, and a visual editor on top — features that would take weeks to build per service.

### Can I use AnythingMCP with Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini / Copilot / Cursor?

Yes. Any client that speaks MCP works. See the [Connect Your AI Client](#connect-your-ai-client-to-the-mcp-server) table for direct setup guides.

### Why source-available and not "open source"?

We use the [Business Source License 1.1](LICENSE) (BSL-1.1), the same model as Sentry, MariaDB, CockroachDB and HashiCorp Terraform. The source is fully public, you can read, fork, modify and self-host — but you can't resell it as a managed SaaS without a commercial license. On **2030-03-04** the license **automatically converts to Apache 2.0**, so the code is guaranteed to become OSI-approved open-source. We chose this over MIT/Apache up-front to keep building AnythingMCP sustainably while avoiding the AWS-strip-mining trap. See the [License FAQ](docs/license-faq.md) for plain-language details.

### Is AnythingMCP free?

Yes, for everyone except SaaS resellers. Free for internal company use, personal use, development, testing, evaluation and academic use. The only restriction is offering it as a hosted commercial service to third parties without a commercial license — and even that restriction lifts on 2030-03-04 when BSL converts to Apache 2.0.

### Can I self-host AnythingMCP?

Yes — it ships as a Docker image and runs on your own infrastructure. Run `./setup.sh` or use the [Railway](https://railway.com/deploy/8-X4WD?referralCode=k30bPV) and [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/anythingmcp) one-click installs. There's also a managed [Cloud version](https://cloud.anythingmcp.com) if you'd rather not run it yourself.

### Is there an MCP server for [DHL / DPD / GLS / DATEV / Weclapp / Personio / Handelsregister / etc.]?

Yes — see the [Pre-configured MCP Connectors](#pre-configured-mcp-connectors) table above. Each adapter has its own setup guide on [anythingmcp.com](https://anythingmcp.com/guides). If your service isn't there yet, you can add it in 10 minutes by copying an existing JSON adapter and adapting the endpoints.

### What about SOAP and WSDL?

Built-in. AnythingMCP automatically parses WSDL documents and generates one MCP tool per SOAP operation. Useful for legacy enterprise APIs (SAP, Oracle, .NET WCF, banking middleware) that no AI client speaks natively.

### Can the AI access my production database directly?

Yes, with safety. AnythingMCP supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB and SQLite. Each tool is whitelisted, every invocation is audit-logged, and you can scope a connector to read-only credentials. See the [Database Connector Guide](docs/connectors/database.md).

### How is auth handled?

OAuth2 (PKCE + Client Credentials), Bearer Token, API Key, Basic Auth, query-parameter auth, WS-Security and TLS client certificates are all supported. Credentials are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest. Per-user MCP API keys are issued on top so each AI client gets its own key with usage tracking.
