> **🏭 Origin story.** AnythingMCP started inside a German industrial group that needed AI agents to talk to 15+ legacy systems (ERP, CRM, custom SOAP, on-prem Postgres). Writing one MCP server per system would have taken weeks each; we extracted the common gateway after the third rewrite and have been running it in production for ~6 months. We open-sourced it because the catalog grows faster as a community than as a single vendor. Built by a small team using AI coding assistants — see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).

## What is AnythingMCP?

**AnythingMCP** is a self-hosted, source-available **MCP server** and **API gateway** that turns your existing APIs into [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools. Connect **any** API — REST, SOAP, GraphQL, databases, or other MCP servers — and expose them to **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Copilot**, **Cursor**, and any other MCP-compatible client.

No SDK. No code changes. Point, configure, connect.

**Built-in adapters** ship with the catalog so you get an instant MCP server for popular SaaS and public APIs — DHL, DPD, GLS, Shipcloud, Sendcloud, Deutsche Bahn, DATEV, Weclapp, Xentral, Shopware 6, Personio, Handelsregister, VIES VAT, OpenPLZ, HERE Geocoding, Oxomi and more ([full list below](#pre-configured-mcp-connectors)).

---

## Get started in 60 seconds

> **Requires** Docker 24+, `bash`, `openssl`. On macOS, start Docker Desktop first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp.git
cd anythingmcp && ./setup.sh
# When setup finishes, open http://localhost:3000 and register
# the first user — they automatically become the admin.
```

> ⚠️ **Register immediately after setup.** The first account to register becomes Admin. If your instance is reachable from the internet during setup, configure firewall rules or bind the UI to `127.0.0.1` until you've created the admin account.

## Pre-configured MCP connectors

AnythingMCP ships with **37+ ready-to-use adapters** — DACH-rooted but reaching the UK, India, Brasil, Nigeria, Japan and the global gaming web3 space. Provide your API credentials at import time and the tools become available immediately. Each adapter has its own setup guide on [anythingmcp.com](https://anythingmcp.com/guides) (English, German, Italian).

> 📍 **Catalog heads-up.** The starting set leans DACH (Germany / Austria / Switzerland) because that's where this was built in production first, with first-wave international coverage now landing across 🇬🇧 UK, 🇮🇳 India, 🇧🇷 Brasil, 🇳🇬 Nigeria and 🇯🇵 Japan. US/APAC SaaS adapters are very welcome as community PRs — there's a [good-first-issue](https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp/issues/150) walking you through adding one in ~30 minutes (single JSON file).

**Want to add your own?** Drop a JSON adapter in `packages/backend/src/adapters/` (organised by region — e.g. `de/`), register it in `catalog.ts`, and it becomes available to every user. The `catalog.spec.ts` parametrised test validates every adapter at build time. See the existing adapters and the [Tool Definition Format](docs/tool-definition.md) for the expected schema.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp.git
cd anythingmcp
./setup.sh        # interactive setup — generates .env, starts Docker
```

The setup script configures everything interactively: deployment mode, domain/SSL, auth, email, Redis. All secrets are auto-generated. First user to register becomes Admin.

**What `setup.sh` handles**

- **Domain &amp; HTTPS** — for production domains, enables Caddy reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL
- **Secrets** — generates JWT, encryption keys, and database passwords
- **MCP authentication mode** — OAuth 2.0, API Key, or both
- **Optional** — SMTP and Redis configuration

> **Prefer manual setup?** Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, edit the values, and run `docker compose up -d`. See the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

| Service | Default URL |
|---|---|
| Web UI | `http://localhost:3000` (or `https://yourdomain.com` with Caddy) |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:4000` |
| MCP endpoint | `http://localhost:4000/mcp` |
| Swagger docs | `http://localhost:4000/api/docs` |

> **Next** — create a connector, import your API spec, and connect your AI client. See [Connector guides](#connector-guides) below.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.png" alt="AnythingMCP architecture — your systems on the left connect through the AnythingMCP gateway to your AI clients on the right" width="100%" />
</p>

**How it works**

1. **Create a connector** — point to your API (REST base URL, WSDL endpoint, GraphQL URL, DB connection string) or pick a pre-built adapter from the catalog
2. **Import or define tools** — auto-import from OpenAPI / Postman / WSDL / GraphQL or define manually (pre-built adapters skip this step)
3. **Connect AI clients** — point your MCP client to `http://your-server:4000/mcp`
4. **AI calls tools** — AnythingMCP translates MCP tool calls into actual API requests and returns results

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What is an MCP server?</strong></summary>

An MCP server exposes tools to an AI agent over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — an open standard from Anthropic. Once connected, the AI can call those tools to read data, run queries, or perform actions on your behalf. AnythingMCP is a self-hosted MCP server that wraps your existing APIs so you don't have to write one from scratch.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is AnythingMCP different from writing my own MCP server?</strong></summary>

You don't write code. AnythingMCP imports your OpenAPI / Postman / WSDL spec (or you point it at a database) and generates the MCP tools automatically. You also get auth, audit logging, RBAC, and a visual editor on top — features that would take weeks to build per service.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use it with Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini / Copilot / Cursor?</strong></summary>

Yes. Any client that speaks MCP works. See [Connect your AI client](#connect-your-ai-client) for direct setup guides.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why source-available and not "open source"?</strong></summary>

We use the [Business Source License 1.1](LICENSE) (BSL-1.1), the same model as Sentry, MariaDB, CockroachDB and HashiCorp Terraform. The source is fully public — you can read, fork, modify and self-host — but you can't resell it as a managed SaaS without a commercial license. On **2030-03-04** the license **automatically converts to Apache 2.0**, so the code is guaranteed to become OSI-approved open-source. We chose this over MIT/Apache up-front to keep building AnythingMCP sustainably while avoiding the AWS-strip-mining trap. See the [License FAQ](docs/license-faq.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is AnythingMCP free?</strong></summary>

Yes, for everyone except SaaS resellers. Free for internal company use, personal use, development, testing, evaluation and academic use. The only restriction is offering it as a hosted commercial service to third parties without a commercial license — and even that lifts on 2030-03-04 when BSL converts to Apache 2.0.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I self-host?</strong></summary>

Yes — it ships as a Docker image and runs on your own infrastructure. Run `./setup.sh` or use the [Railway](https://railway.com/deploy/8-X4WD?referralCode=k30bPV) and [DigitalOcean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/anythingmcp) one-click installs. There's also a managed [Cloud version](https://cloud.anythingmcp.com) if you'd rather not run it yourself.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there an MCP server for DHL / DATEV / Personio / Handelsregister / …?</strong></summary>

Yes — see [Pre-configured MCP connectors](#pre-configured-mcp-connectors). Each adapter has its own setup guide on [anythingmcp.com](https://anythingmcp.com/guides). If your service isn't there yet, you can add it in ~10 minutes by copying an existing JSON adapter and adapting the endpoints.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about SOAP and WSDL?</strong></summary>

Built-in. AnythingMCP automatically parses WSDL documents and generates one MCP tool per SOAP operation. Useful for legacy enterprise APIs (SAP, Oracle, .NET WCF, banking middleware) that no AI client speaks natively.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is MCP dead now that agents use CLI tools?</strong></summary>

No — but the question conflates two problems. CLI is the right call when the model already knows the tool from training (`git`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `aws`, `gh`), the agent is acting for the builder, and a CLI actually exists. MCP wins when you need per-user auth, scoped permissions, audit logs, multi-tenant isolation, typed contracts, or SaaS integrations without a CLI (Salesforce, Workday, Notion, Linear, internal tools).

The mature pattern in 2026 is **hybrid**: CLI for local/dev/popular tools, MCP for SaaS / multi-tenant / compliance-bound integrations. AnythingMCP covers the MCP side — you keep using `git` and `docker` directly, the gateway handles everything else with proper auth and audit. Full decision matrix on [anythingmcp.com/vs/cli](https://anythingmcp.com/vs/cli).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the AI access my production database directly?</strong></summary>

Yes, with safety. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB and SQLite are supported. Each tool is whitelisted, every invocation is audit-logged, and you can scope a connector to read-only credentials. See the [Database Connector Guide](docs/connectors/database.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is auth handled?</strong></summary>

OAuth2 (PKCE + Client Credentials), Bearer Token, API Key, Basic Auth, query-parameter auth, WS-Security and TLS client certificates are all supported. Credentials are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest. Per-user MCP API keys are issued on top so each AI client gets its own key with usage tracking.
