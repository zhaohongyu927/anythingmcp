 * Auto-inject five generic GraphQL helper tools onto any GRAPHQL adapter:
 *   - `<slug>_graphql_schema_url`   — returns the URL of the SDL schema (or the value of
 *                                     `connector.schemaUrl` if the adapter overrides it)
 *   - `<slug>_graphql_schema`       — proxy + filter the SDL: returns a compact summary,
 *                                     a single type definition (`type: "X"`), a search
 *                                     slice (`search: "card"`), or the full SDL (`full: true`)
 *   - `<slug>_graphql_query`        — execute an arbitrary `query` document
 *   - `<slug>_graphql_mutation`     — execute an arbitrary `mutation` document
 *   - `<slug>_graphql_subscription` — execute an arbitrary `subscription` document
 *                                     (transport availability depends on the upstream API)
 *
 * These give an MCP agent a fallback path when no purpose-built tool covers a
 * needed operation — the agent fetches a focused slice of the schema, composes
 * the operation, and runs it. Adapter authors don't need to declare them.
