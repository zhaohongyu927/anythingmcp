/**
 * Standalone stdio MCP server for directory evaluation (Glama, MCP Inspector).
 *
 * Glama scores a server by building its Dockerfile, starting it, and sending
 * MCP introspection (initialize + tools/list). It requires a server that runs
 * LOCALLY and self-contained (no external endpoint proxy, no external DB).
 *
 * The full AnythingMCP gateway needs PostgreSQL to boot, so it can't run in
 * Glama's sandbox. This tiny script has NO dependency on the app, NestJS,
 * Prisma or any database — it only needs @modelcontextprotocol/sdk + zod. It
 * exposes the same static, self-describing "how to use AnythingMCP" tools as
 * the public /mcp/demo endpoint, so Glama can introspect a working server and
 * assign a quality score. It exposes no customer data.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/glama-stdio-demo.mjs   (speaks MCP over stdio)

const OVERVIEW = `AnythingMCP is a self-hosted, open-source MCP gateway that turns any API, database or MCP server into custom connectors for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot and Cursor — no code.

This is a read-only demo server that describes the product; it exposes no customer data.

  git clone ${REPO}.git
  cd anythingmcp && ./setup.sh

Open http://localhost:3000, register the first user (admin), import an API spec
(OpenAPI/Postman/WSDL/GraphQL) or pick a pre-built adapter, assign it to an MCP
server, then connect your AI client to http://localhost:4000/mcp.
